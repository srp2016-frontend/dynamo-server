#README
The dynamo-server module has made installing and using the frontend for the SRP 2016's Dynamo project much simpler.

First, install npm (node package manager) and Python (version 3 or newer). Then run the server.py file with Python. The first time you run it, it may take a few minutes to install the dependencies.

While the server is running, all changes you make to the website (found under the folder dynamo-website) are automatically compiled and saved. View the newest version of the site by going to localhost:8000 in your browser. When you make a change to the site, refresh the page to see it updated.
